# 0x06. Star Wars API
## Description
This project focuses on creating a command-line tool that interacts with the Star Wars API to retrieve information about Star Wars characters and their appearances in films. The task emphasizes making asynchronous HTTP requests to retrieve data efficiently and handle nested API calls.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, I was able to:

- Work with APIs and understand their structure.
- Use Node.js to perform HTTP requests.
- Handle asynchronous operations using callbacks or promises.
- Parse and manipulate JSON responses from APIs.
- Build a simple CLI tool for data retrieval.
