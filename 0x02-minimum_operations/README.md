# 0x02. Minimum Operations
## Description
This project focuses on solving the Minimum Operations problem. The goal of the task is to determine the minimum number of operations needed to achieve exactly n 'H' characters in a text file, starting with only one 'H'. The only operations allowed are:

Copy All: You can copy all the characters from the file to a clipboard.
Paste: You can paste the characters from the clipboard into the file.
The challenge is to compute the fewest operations needed to reach exactly n characters using the operations defined.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, I was able to:

- Understand how to break down problems into smaller subproblems.
- Recognize patterns in problem-solving using operations and basic algorithms.
- Implement an algorithm to find the minimum number of operations to achieve a goal with specific constraints.
