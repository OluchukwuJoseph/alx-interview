# 0x01-lockboxes

## Description
In this project, I worked on the Lockboxes problem. Imagine you have a collection of boxes, each containing keys that can open other boxes. Your task is to determine if you can open all the boxes, starting with the first box (Box 0). The keys inside the boxes can open other boxes, allowing access to additional keys.

This project emphasizes problem-solving using algorithms and required me to efficiently determine if all the boxes can be unlocked.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, I learnt the following skills:

- Algorithmic thinking: I learnt how to approach and solve complex problems using algorithms.
- Graph traversal: The problem can be approached as a graph traversal task where each box represents a node and the keys represent edges to other nodes.
- Python programming: I strengthen my Python programming skills, particularly in handling loops, conditionals, and lists.
