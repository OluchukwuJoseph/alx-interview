# 0x00-pascal_triangle
Welcome to the 0x00-pascal_triangle repository! This project focuses on generating Pascal's Triangle, a mathematical construct that has applications in combinatorics, algebra, and number theory. It is designed to help you practice problem-solving skills and improve your understanding of algorithms.

## Project Overview
Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of the binomial coefficients. Each number is the sum of the two directly above it. The project consists of a function that generates the triangle up to a specified number of rows. This project helps in understanding recursion, iteration, and the mathematical significance of the triangle.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, I was able to:

- Understand the structure and properties of Pascal's Triangle.
- Implement algorithms to generate Pascal's Triangle in an efficient manner.
- Apply concepts of recursion and iteration in your code.
- Gain experience in writing clean, maintainable, and well-documented code.
