# 0x09. Island Perimeter
## Description
This project focuses on solving the Island Perimeter problem, a common algorithmic challenge involving grid-based computations. The task involves determining the perimeter of an "island" represented in a 2D grid, where 1 represents land and 0 represents water. The grid is rectangular and fully surrounded by water. This project reinforces problem-solving skills in grid traversal and handling edge cases.

## Learning Objectives
After completing this project, I:

- Understood how to represent and navigate a 2D grid.
- Learnt techniques for counting perimeter based on grid neighbors.
- Explored edge cases in grid-based algorithms.
- Strengthend skills in Python, especially in efficient data processing.
