# 0x0A. Prime Game

## Description

**Prime Game** is a programming project that involves solving a mathematical game using algorithms and computational logic. The game is played between two players, Maria and Ben, who take turns choosing prime numbers and removing their multiples from a list. The winner is the player with the most turns when the list is exhausted.

The objective of this project is to implement an efficient algorithm to determine the winner of the game after a given number of rounds.
