# 0x08. Making Change
## Description
This project focuses on solving the minimum coin change problem, an important concept in algorithm design and optimization. You will write a Python function that calculates the minimum number of coins needed to achieve a given amount of money, using a list of available denominations. This problem is commonly used to teach greedy algorithms and dynamic programming concepts.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, I:

- Understood the coin change problem and its real-world applications.
- Learnt when and how to apply greedy algorithms effectively.
- Explored edge cases in problem-solving.
- Develop efficient Python code for solving optimization problems.
